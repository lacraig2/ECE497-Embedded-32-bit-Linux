# Homework 1

## Requirements
For this homework I did the following:
1. installing the latest shipped image on the BeagleBone
    - I downloaded and installed this.
2. setting up a host computer with Linux for kernel development
    - I installed a ubuntu as a dual boot.
3. gathering all the needed SD cards, cables, etc.
    - I bought SD cards and acquired cables from the parts room.
4. installing git on a your host
    - I installed git on my host and beagle.
5. signing up for the two beagle Google groups (See Working With Open Source)
    - I signed up for these groups.
6. writing a simple Etch-a-sketch program
    - The following are requirements on the Etch-a-sketch program. It resides in the etch_a_sketch.py file provided.

## Etch-a-sketch

### Requirements:
A unix system with Python 2 or 3. This only requires the curses library in python (should be default on Unix systems).

### Usage:

- This sets up an 8x8 etch a sketch game. (default)

    `python etch_a_sketch.py`

- This sets up a 9x9 etch a sketch game.

    `python etch_a_sketch.py -n 9`

- This sets up a 7x4 etch a sketch game.

    `python etch_a_sketch.py -n 7 -m 4`
